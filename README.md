# Brodys Portfolio

Welcome!

I'm currently a computer science student at Weber State University and a programmer at Pye Barker FS. At Pye, I focus on creating applications that streamline user interaction with Sedona. 
I've contributed to two key projects:
- **Parts Consolidation Tool:** Designed to remove and consolidate duplicate parts in our parts table, improving data accuracy. The parts table has become quite giant as the company brings in new businesses and with
    this tool it helps provide a more streamline way for parts to be consolidated and transfer respective data to one single part.
-  **Workspace Application:** Currently in development, this app aims to remove traffic from Sedona by providing a  workspace for sales and other team members, enhancing their experience when accessing customer data.
  
This repository showcases some of my group and individual projects, including a Banking App, Hangman Game, and more.
These projects demonstrate the skills and knowledge I've gained throughout my software engineering journey. Enjoy exploring!
